## [Unreleased]

### Added
* The client now saves the player/remote setting in the browser.
* The noise toggle button now shows an animation when the noise is running.
* Added the flow for authenticating a remote with a specific player.
* Added a volume slider that is kept in sync between the player and the remotes.


## [0.1.0] - 2019-11-02

### Added
* Prototype of the general concept. This includes the ability to have one machine be the player and any number of other devices be the remotes. At this point there is no access controll, all remotes controll all players at once.
